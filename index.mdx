### Referral Management

Referral Management is our base offering and is a required module. Referral Management in Aidin allows you to send intelligent referrals to many different levels of care, including—but not limited to—skilled nursing, rehab, home health, drug rehab, inpatient and outpatient psych, and dialysis. Aidin's referral management includes payer and CMS integration to see in-network and high-quality search results. The referral management suite helps manage post-acutes and tracks each task to reduce LOS. 

### Post Acute Authorizations & Utilization Review
Aidin can send, track, and complete inpatient authorization requests or post-acute authorizations with payers & post-acute providers with the Post Acute Authorizations & Utilizations module. Portal integration, transparency of authorization status, easy communication, and real-time flagging of delays in Aidin reduce delays associated with authorizations. Detailed reporting on authorization minimizes turnaround times for post-acute providers. 

### Emergency and Non-Emergency Transport
Aidin’s Emergency and Non-Emergency Transport module helps your staff set up and coordinate timely transport for patients. The platform provides basic to advanced medical transport at the click of a button. Aidin’s Transports module has reduced transport-related delays for every organization that uses it.

### IMM/MOON/Medicare Form Compliance & Automation
The IMM/MOON/Medicare Form Compliance & Automation module allows users to send and receive compliance documents without missing a beat, including signatures and delivery of IMMs/MOONs/HINNs to patients or physicians.

### Population Health and Care Plans
Our Pop Health module allows tracking of the patient's journey and data across the continuum – define criteria for your population health networks, run reports on patient progression, and track outcomes once the patient is at the post-acute provider.
