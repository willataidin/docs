Before launch, Aidin needs to configure menus, document templates, and other workflows with your data to optimize your experience.  Aidin will share a spreadsheet to facilitate this exchange of information.  The first tab of the worksheet provides a template through which you provide the facilities of your system. Tab 1 is a pre-requisite to Essential integrations.  **Aidin recommends that you save this spreadsheet to Sharepoint (or your equivalent productivity suite) and then invite the Aidin team to access it. This allows multiple users to provide the information we need without having to email attachments back and forth.**

### **Post-Acute Care Network & Outreach** 

Aidin conducts outreach to your existing network of post-acute providers via automated email and fax campaigns. Aidin cross-references and de-duplicates this information against its existing database of providers before outreach begins, but incomplete information can lead to a poor experience for your PAC partners. Please provide this information on tab 3 of the accompanying worksheet.

### **Insurance Information** 

Aidin needs a one-time extract of all insurance providers your health system has interacted with in the past year. This data helps Aidin ensure accurate tracking of insurance information and supports processing authorization requests and finding the right in-network providers. The data provides valuable insights into the your payer mix and is crucial for aligning referral processes with provider and payor requirements. Please provide this information on tab 4 of the accompanying worksheet.

### **Bulk User Upload** 

Aidin prefers not to bulk add users, but in some implementations – specifically those without “auto-provisioned” users, this becomes a requirement. Not only does this create an extra step for both sides during an implementation, it does not align with best practice – your identity management solution (IdP) should be the source of truth for who can access Aidin on your behalf, not a spreadsheet. 

If bulk user add is a requirement because your team cannot configure SSO or groups/SAML claims, please complete the “Users” tab in the accompanying worksheet. Keep in mind that after go-live, your Aidin admins will need to manage user access directly in the platform.  Aidin cannot manage user access on your behalf post-launch.
