This is a technical integration guide for the Aidin software suite intended for health systems. Enterprise post-acute care providers looking for technical integration information should consult the [Post-Acute Integration Guide](/receivers/integration). 

For more information about what Aidin’s Post-Acute Referral workflow software does, or for information about Aidin’s software architecture, security, or compliance program, please review our IT Overview.  

The Aidin application is extremely customizable and can be used to support a wide variety of document and referral workflows throughout a health system. The components necessary for all Aidin health systems customers – e.g. Authentication, ADT feeds and document retrieval — are described in the first half of the document, under [Essential Integrations](#essential-integrations). 

Aidin supports a number of [advanced configurations](/integration/advanced) that are not relevant to all customers. These configurations allow Aidin to push data back into or retrieve documents from your EHR via FHIR or HL7 MDM, integrate with third party APIs, or perform other workflows that are adjacent to core Aidin set up activities. **Aidin prioritizes essential integrations – in both sandbox and production environments – before moving on to advanced integrations, which are often not necessary to go-live.** This allows your system the most flexibility in determining timelines and communication plans.

Finally, to go live with Aidin, the system must be populated with the [content](/integration/content) that your Care Managers need to perform their function in Aidin. Much of this data will already be flowing when essential integrations are established, but some content (previous post-acute partners, ADT insurance plans, etc.) are seeded for you by an Aidin implementation team member using a worksheet that accompanies this document.

As described in the project plan or kick off deck, Aidin generally sees customers complete the necessary steps for integration in 2-3 months. The Aidin team will work with you to develop a customized go-live schedule and share regular milestones and updates. 

##  Roles and Teams

Aidin’s implementation team has the following roles:

* **Project Manager.** Our project manager will handle scheduling, capturing meeting notes and follow ups, and progress reporting.  
* **Solutions Engineer.** Our solutions engineer will work with your IT teams to help you get the integrations you need set up.  
* **Implementation Manager.** Our Implementation Manager will work with you to make sure your Aidin instance is configured correctly to meet your goals.

We will need access to representatives from the following teams within your organization:

* Care Management Leadership  
* Interfaces / API (Bridges / Interconnect / FHIR)  
* Networking / Technical Services   
* Identity Management/Authentication  
* ClinDocs or Clinical Reporting

## Environments

Aidin has two software environments that you will work with: Sandbox and Production. Our Sandbox is where integrations and configurations are tested and user training is conducted. You can continue to use Sandbox for the life of the contract. Sandbox receives new code and features in advance of Production, so if there are new features that our team would like to preview with you, it will be in Sandbox. Your team must acknowledge that no real patient or referral data may be added to the Sandbox environment.

Production is your live environment that hosts your team’s live data and work.

The primary Aidin web application environments are:

* Sandbox: [https://sandbox.myaidin.com](https://sandbox.myaidin.com)  
* Production: [https://next.myaidin.com](https://next.myaidin.com)

## Pre-Integration Steps

### **Allowlisting**

All Aidin emails will come from myaidin.com with DKIM signatures. Please ask whoever manages your email infrastructure to allowlist this email domain. If your organization has to explicitly allow web and other network applications, please ask them to allowlist the following domains and or IP addresses. Allowing by hostname is preferred, as IP addresses may require occasional updates.

| Hostname | Protocol/Port | Purpose | IP[^1] |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| next.myaidin.com  | https/443 | Production web application | 107.21.248.23354.225.217.191 |
| sandbox.myaidin.com  | https/443 | Test and training web application | 54.210.79.4818.209.76.41 |
| open.myaidin.com  | https/443 | Production SSO and installed printer  | by hostname only |
| printer.next.myaidin.com  | https/443ipps/631 | Production IPP printer | by hostname only |
| printer.sandbox.myaidin.com | https/443ipps/631 | Test IPPS printer | by hostname only |
| connect.next.myaidin.com | https(customer specific port) | Production ADT feeds | To Aidin:52.22.107.1754.157.186.159 |
| connect.next.myaidin.com | https (customer defined port) | Production MDM feeds | From Aidin:52.204.44.228 |
| connect.sandbox.myaidin.com | https(customer specific port) | Test ADT feeds | by hostname only |
| connect.sandbox.myaidin.com | https(customer defined port) | Test MDM feeds | From Aidin:35.171.171.132 |
| sftp.next.myaidin.com | sftp/22 | Production inbound/outbound sftp | by hostname only |
| sftp.sandbox.myaidin.com | sftp/22 | Test inbound/outbound sftp | by hostname only |

Please email your Aidin team when these actions have been completed. 

### **Facilities**

Before we begin with technical integration, Aidin must understand the set of physical facilities (sometimes hospitals or campuses) that will be used to segment your data within the Aidin application. Every user is associated with one or more facilities in the application, governing what a user can see and what they do not have access to. 

The first tab of the spreadsheet that accompanies this document includes the information we need to begin. Please provide the name, facility code (from your EHR) and address of every campus or facility that should appear in the application at the outset of the integration project. Future integration steps cannot be completed without this information.

### **Identifying Technical Contacts**

Beyond the integration project, Aidin requires email addresses from your technical team for various notification and troubleshooting purposes.

* **Technical Liaison**. Notification about changes of configuration or policy that may require them to do technical work. Often a real human stakeholder.  
* **Site-wide automatic notifications**. An email address that should receive automatic notifications from our [status page](https://status.myaidin.com/) in the event of site-wide downtime.   
* **ADT-feed specific troubleshooting**. An email address that receives automatic notification if your ADT feed data stops, causing stale data in the Aidin system.  
* **Analytics Liaison.** If you expect to ingest Aidin data into a BI or analytics platform to create your own dashboards, please provide a contact that will work directly with Aidin’s Data Engineers.

Please identify these individuals or email addresses to your Aidin team members.
