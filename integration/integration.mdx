This is a technical integration guide for the Aidin software suite intended for health systems. Enterprise post-acute care providers looking for technical integration information should consult the Aidin Post-Acute Integration Guide. 

For more information about what Aidin’s Post-Acute Referral workflow software does, or for information about Aidin’s software architecture, security, or compliance program, please review our IT Overview.  

The Aidin application is extremely customizable and can be used to support a wide variety of document and referral workflows throughout a health system. The components necessary for all Aidin health systems customers – e.g. Authentication, ADT feeds and document retrieval — are described in the first half of the document, under [Essential Integrations](#essential-integrations). 

Aidin supports a number of additional configurations that are not relevant to all customers. These configurations allow Aidin to push data back into or retrieve documents from your EHR via FHIR or HL7 MDM, integrate with third party APIs, or perform other workflows that are adjacent to core Aidin set up activities. **Aidin prioritizes essential integrations – in both sandbox and production environments – before moving on to advanced integrations, which are often not necessary to go-live.** This allows your system the most flexibility in determining timelines and communication plans.

Finally, to go live with Aidin, the system must be populated with the content that your Care Managers need to perform their function in Aidin. Much of this data will already be flowing when essential integrations are established, but some content (previous post-acute partners, ADT insurance plans, etc.) are seeded for you by an Aidin implementation team member using a worksheet that accompanies this document.

As described in the project plan or kick off deck, Aidin generally sees customers complete the necessary steps for integration in 2-3 months. The Aidin team will work with you to develop a customized go-live schedule and share regular milestones and updates. 

##  Roles and Teams

Aidin’s implementation team has the following roles:

* **Project Manager.** Our project manager will handle scheduling, capturing meeting notes and follow ups, and progress reporting.  
* **Solutions Engineer.** Our solutions engineer will work with your IT teams to help you get the integrations you need set up.  
* **Implementation Manager.** Our Implementation Manager will work with you to make sure your Aidin instance is configured correctly to meet your goals.

We will need access to representatives from the following teams within your organization:

* Care Management Leadership  
* Interfaces / API (Bridges / Interconnect / FHIR)  
* Networking / Technical Services   
* Identity Management/Authentication  
* ClinDocs or Clinical Reporting

## Environments

Aidin has two software environments that you will work with: Sandbox and Production. Our Sandbox is where integrations and configurations are tested and user training is conducted. You can continue to use Sandbox for the life of the contract. Sandbox receives new code and features in advance of Production, so if there are new features that our team would like to preview with you, it will be in Sandbox. Your team must acknowledge that no real patient or referral data may be added to the Sandbox environment.

Production is your live environment that hosts your team’s live data and work.

The primary Aidin web application environments are:

* Sandbox: [https://sandbox.myaidin.com](https://sandbox.myaidin.com)  
* Production: [https://next.myaidin.com](https://next.myaidin.com)

##  

## Pre-Integration Steps

### **Allowlisting**

All Aidin emails will come from myaidin.com with DKIM signatures. Please ask whoever manages your email infrastructure to allowlist this email domain. If your organization has to explicitly allow web and other network applications, please ask them to allowlist the following domains and or IP addresses. Allowing by hostname is preferred, as IP addresses may require occasional updates.

| Hostname | Protocol/Port | Purpose | IP[^1] |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| next.myaidin.com  | https/443 | Production web application | 107.21.248.23354.225.217.191 |
| sandbox.myaidin.com  | https/443 | Test and training web application | 54.210.79.4818.209.76.41 |
| open.myaidin.com  | https/443 | Production SSO and installed printer  | by hostname only |
| printer.next.myaidin.com  | https/443ipps/631 | Production IPP printer | by hostname only |
| printer.sandbox.myaidin.com | https/443ipps/631 | Test IPPS printer | by hostname only |
| connect.next.myaidin.com | https(customer specific port) | Production ADT feeds | To Aidin:52.22.107.1754.157.186.159 |
| connect.next.myaidin.com | https (customer defined port) | Production MDM feeds | From Aidin:52.204.44.228 |
| connect.sandbox.myaidin.com | https(customer specific port) | Test ADT feeds | by hostname only |
| connect.sandbox.myaidin.com | https(customer defined port) | Test MDM feeds | From Aidin:35.171.171.132 |
| sftp.next.myaidin.com | sftp/22 | Production inbound/outbound sftp | by hostname only |
| sftp.sandbox.myaidin.com | sftp/22 | Test inbound/outbound sftp | by hostname only |

Please email your Aidin team when these actions have been completed. 

### **Facilities**

Before we begin with technical integration, Aidin must understand the set of physical facilities (sometimes hospitals or campuses) that will be used to segment your data within the Aidin application. Every user is associated with one or more facilities in the application, governing what a user can see and what they do not have access to. 

The first tab of the spreadsheet that accompanies this document includes the information we need to begin. Please provide the name, facility code (from your EHR) and address of every campus or facility that should appear in the application at the outset of the integration project. Future integration steps cannot be completed without this information.

### **Identifying Technical Contacts**

Beyond the integration project, Aidin requires email addresses from your technical team for various notification and troubleshooting purposes.

* **Technical Liaison**. Notification about changes of configuration or policy that may require them to do technical work. Often a real human stakeholder.  
* **Site-wide automatic notifications**. An email address that should receive automatic notifications from our [status page](https://status.myaidin.com/) in the event of site-wide downtime.   
* **ADT-feed specific troubleshooting**. An email address that receives automatic notification if your ADT feed data stops, causing stale data in the Aidin system.  
* **Analytics Liaison.** If you expect to ingest Aidin data into a BI or analytics platform to create your own dashboards, please provide a contact that will work directly with Aidin’s Data Engineers.

Please identify these individuals or email addresses to your Aidin team members.

## Essential Integrations

The integrations required to make Aidin functional are the following: 

* User authentication and provisioning (Single Sign On)  
* EHR launch button  
* An ADT feed  
* One or more non-FHIR document retrieval configurations  
* Outbound analytics data 

Aidin can be successfully integrated and used without FHIR-based integrations. Integrating via FHIR and HL7 MDM options allow more control over the user’s workflow and more data to be sent back to the EHR, but should be considered adjacent to Aidin’s primary functionality.

### **Authentication and Access Control**

Your care managers log into Aidin using your own user identity and authentication system, generally called an Identity Provider (IdP) through a process called Single Sign On (SSO). Microsoft Entra and Shibboleth are common IdPs that implement SSO protocols.  

Some healthcare systems own and operate post-acute care providers that will also need to login through SSO.  If this is the case at your organization, please highlight this with the Aidin integration team.

In order to support seamless login from both the Aidin website and your EHR system more than one identity integration is sometimes required. Your IdP must be capable of implementing the SAML 2.0 protocol.  Aidin does not support OpenID Connect (OIDC).

SAML 2.0 SSO is set up through an exchange of metadata. Once the teams have exchanged that metadata, your IdP must be configured to pass “claims” to Aidin for each user. These claims tell Aidin which campuses the user has access to, and what role in the Aidin system the user should have.

Aidin strongly recommends, but does not require, that your users are identified by a unique email during the login process. Without an email address some of Aidin’s features will not be available including direct login from the Aidin login page.  Your SAML claims should also include a stable user identifier from your EHR, other than the email address, so that email address changes can be seamlessly supported. This identifier can also be used for user attribution for bi-directional MDM and FHIR workflows. Finally, Aidin can associate one or more email domains with each IdP. The domain is used to support login from the Aidin login page.  Without domains configured for your users only “Launch button” SSO is supported. 

#### **Aidin User Roles**

All Aidin users fall into one of three categories:

* Sender  
* Receiver  
* Both

Hospital System users are typically senders because they are generating and sending referrals to post acute providers. PAC users are generally receivers, because they are receiving referrals from senders. In most cases, receivers use of the application falls under a different commercial agreement than your health system users – receivers are often small businesses in your referral network.

Aidin is capable of supporting users who are both senders and receivers, as some large systems use Aidin to send and receive referrals within their own network, but for the purposes of this document we will consider the following sender roles only:

* Read-only user: someone who is monitoring Aidin sending workflows, but not able to create and send referrals.   
* Standard user: a role with no elevated permissions who can participate in Aidin sending workflows.  
* Administrative user: a role with elevated permissions who is responsible for managing other team members in the application.  
* Reporting user: a role that allows the user to view reporting in the application.

The first three of the above roles are mutually exclusive — if a user is read-only, they cannot also be an Aidin admin. The reporting role can be granted to someone with any of the first three roles.

#### **Auto-provisioning Users**

To simplify set up, Aidin strongly recommends that Aidin is configured to “auto-provision” your users in Aidin. Auto-provisioning users allows decisions about who can access Aidin to be an internal conversation within your organization, removing extra steps and communication from the integration process. It makes your IdP the source of truth about who can access Aidin and prevents the implementation teams from having to bulk add your users.

If you cannot auto-provision users Aidin will need to bulk add your users for go-live.  Please see [Bulk User Upload](#bulk-user-upload). Admin users will have access to ongoing permissions management in the Aidin admin panel if auto-provision is not enabled.

#### **SAML Metadata Exchange Endpoints**

Your team can generate the appropriate metadata for Aidin using the following endpoints. Please note that this endpoint is specific to each IdP – if you have several SSO integrations to enable, you will need to complete this process for each. Ask your Aidin Solutions Engineer for these URLs:

* Sandbox: https://sandbox.myaidin.com/saml/\[idp-slug\]/metadata  
* Production: https://next.myaidin.com/saml/\[idp-slug\]/metadata

For more information about configuring Microsoft Entra for SAML 2 authentication, please see the Entra [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/architecture/auth-saml). If you are not an Entra user, please consult your Authentication team.

#### **Mapping Group Membership to Aidin Roles**

The information about what facility a user has access to, and which role the user has is provided to the Aidin system by your IdP during login. Your Authentication team must configure groups in your IdP that represent these combinations of permissions. The IdP should be configured to present one or more of these groups using the ‘MemberOf’ attribute during the login process. 

Please use tab 2 of the accompanying worksheet to provide the list of group identifiers as well as the facilities and Aidin roles they should be associated with when you have confirmed configuration. Aidin will map these groups onto facilities and roles in our system, maintaining a membership group for each of your Identity Management team’s configured groups. 

User access is validated against all mapped membership groups at the start of each application session to stay synchronized with your IdP configurations. Any changes to location access, role level or email addresses (assuming you’ve provided a stable user ID other than email address) will be reflected in Aidin upon each user’s next login. If group memberships are enabled, Aidin locks down team member administration by admin end users in the application to ensure that your Identity Management team has sole control over user access and identity changes.

### **Aidin Launch Button**

Your care managers will need to launch the Aidin application from within your EHR via a custom “launch button” that starts the authentication process.  Your team will need to add a button that launches a browser session at a particular URL that initiates the Secure Token Service (STS) SAML authentication flow described above. This can be accomplished in one of several different ways depending on your EHR. [Appendix 2](#appendix-2:-procedures-for-epic-launch-button) provides guidance on how to implement the launch button in Epic.

### **ADT Feed**

All Aidin use cases require a standard “admission discharge transfer” (ADT) feed from your EHR. This feed provides the relevant patient information that Care Managers need to create referrals. 

#### **mTLS configuration**

The first step in setting up an ADT feed is establishing network connectivity between your EHR and the Aidin system. Aidin strongly prefers mTLS over virtual private networking (VPN). For more on why Aidin prefers mTLS, please ask for our whitepaper on the subject. Integrations that require VPN require additional set up steps and the ongoing services of network engineers on both sides.

Mutual TLS means that both Aidin and your system verify certificates before allowing a connection to be made.  Port numbers will vary by integration and should be agreed upon between your networking team and the Aidin Solutions Engineer. You will need to provide a certificate to the Aidin Solutions Engineer during setup.

Aidin also supports TLS 1.2+ integrations without mutual certificate verification. If this is your preferred mechanism, please provide the static IP from which we should expect your traffic.

#### **Configuring ADT**

Once initial connectivity is established by your Interface or Networking team the Aidin team will inspect the contents of your ADT messages. Questions will sometimes arise about which codes should be mapped to which facility, or which patient identifier is being sent. A meeting will generally be required to confirm these details.  Your team can make this process more efficient by accurately completing the ADT interface mapping tab of the accompanying workbook.

See [Appendix 3](#heading=h.o05mmiey8bix) for more information about setting up your ADT feed.

### **“Push” Document Retrieval**

Care Managers must send various documents from your EHR, and perhaps other sources, in order to complete a patient transition. EHR document retrieval can be complex and generally represents the most customizable part of Aidin set up. Some documents — typically patient “packets” — are created dynamically within your EHR, often making them inaccessible to standard FHIR-based integration methods. Other documents reside in third party platforms such as OnBase or SharePoint.  Finally, some documents can be retrieved via FHIR DocumentReference endpoints because they are statically associated with a given patient record.

Because of this dichotomy, document workflows can be either “push” or “pull”.  In a push integration, the user action to move the document into Aidin starts outside the Aidin application — typically, but not necessarily — when a user performs some action in the EHR.  Pull integrations, by contrast, start in the Aidin user interface, where a user selects documents to pull into Aidin from some external system (EHR/Onbase, etc.).  Push integrations do not require Aidin to have advance knowledge of the document, and thus are simpler to set up.  Pull integrations require FHIR access to list the available documents and as such, Aidin considers them non-essential. See “[Pull Document Retrieval](#“pull”-document-retrieval)” below.

#### **Pushing Documents to Aidin using Secure File Transfer (SFTP)**

The simplest possible push integration for documents — and one Aidin recommends setting up for every new integration — is Secure File Transfer Protocol.  SFTP is also the way that Aidin sends reporting data back for analytics (See Analytics Data Export below).  Establishing bi-directional SFTP data exchange early on in the integration provides a backup option for more complex document retrieval integrations. 

SFTP integration — both to and from Aidin, involves your team putting or retrieving a document from Aidin’s SFTP server. This is done with asymmetric SSH key pair authentication using the following endpoints and ports:

* Sandbox: sftp://sftp.sandbox.myaidin.com:22  
* Production: sftp://sftp.next.myaidin.com:22

Please generate four sets of SSH key pairs for each environment using the procedures in [Appendix 1](#appendix-1:-procedure-for-creating-ssh-key-pairs) and share **only** the public keys with the Aidin team (Aidin prefers separate key pairs for read and write operations in SFTP).  It is safe to email public key information.  Multiple public keys per environment can be supported at once for zero-downtime key rotation.

Once read/write key pairs have been generated for each environment and the public key shared with Aidin, the parties must decide whether optional IP whitelisting is required, and a connectivity test should be conducted using the Sandbox endpoints listed above.

##### **Configuring your EHR for Pushing to SFTP**

To use SFTP to send documents to Aidin, your Interface team will need to configure your EHR to allow it to either print or save the documents to the SFTP endpoint above upon some action in the EHR’s user interface.  In some cases, this may require consultation with your ClinDocs Team to identify which documents your Care Managers need to send to Aidin.  Epic’s “virtual printing” (EPRs) feature set exists for this purpose and should be considered.

During this stage, the Interface Team should also determine whether Aidin should match documents to patients using MRN, “enterprise MRN”, CSN or some other identifier. This information should be shared with your Aidin solutions engineer. If you need to send documents to Aidin that originate in some other system, SFTP is also an option to accomplish this goal.

The Aidin system automatically identifies, using an array of technologies depending on your commercial agreement, the patient and links it to the appropriate referral record as appropriate. See [Appendix 4](#appendix-4:-configuring-your-ehr-for-pushing-to-sftp) for details on how to prepare your documents for intake.

##### **Leverage your EHR’s fax function to deliver to SFTP** 

Some EHR systems provide built-in faxing capabilities that can be used to securely transmit documents to Aidin without requiring a direct SFTP or network-based interface. Aidin supports a configuration where documents faxed from an EHR are received by Aidin’s inbound fax service and automatically delivered to a configured SFTP server for processing within the established printer workflow in accordance to your commercial agreement. Aidin will provision a fax number that is specific for this workflow and will work with your IT or Communications team to configure this fax contact in your EHR. See [Appendix 4, Optional Setup: Print to Fax Delivery](#optional-setup:-print-to-fax-delivery).

##### **Additional Security Measures** 

While Aidin encrypts all data flowing through SFTP channels in transfer and at rest, your system may be storing documents in an insecure manner prior to initiating the SFTP transfer. If your documents are not being securely stored, or your system requires manually encrypting these files, Aidin offers a second layer of security in the form of GPG encryption. You can encrypt your files with Aidin’s public key prior to storing and sending them. For your convenience, we support both RSA and ed25519 strategies; choose whichever one suits your needs. See [Appendix 4](#appendix-4:-configuring-your-ehr-for-pushing-to-sftp) for the public PGP keys.

To note, this step is optional and should be unnecessary in most circumstances.

#### **Printing**

Documents can come from a variety of sources within and without the EHR and API retrieval may only work for certain document types in the EHR. As a result, some customers may prefer to use printing features to send documents to Aidin. Like SFTP, printing is a “push” workflow–users initiate the print job outside Aidin and then locate and work with the document in the Aidin UI.

Due to the wide variety of customer workstation setups, Aidin has several different print mechanisms. If your team has the capability to roll out IPP-based printing with user-level credentials via your workstation management suite, Aidin prefers that to installing a driver, as it means there is no Aidin software running on your network.  Your workstation team authors a deployment script that uses a preshared secret and the user’s email address to generate (using HMAC \+ SHA256) a set of basic or digest authentication credentials that identify the user who is printing to Aidin. Please see [Appendix 5](#appendix-5:-ipp-printer-without-installed-driver-application) for more information about setting up an IPP printer without the Aidin installer.

Some health systems install an Aidin-authored, installed Windows 10 print driver application that presents an authentication flow and then a simple user interface that allows the customer to select a patient with whom to identify the document. This driver application can be configured either to send Postscript files over HTTPS OR to use the operating system’s native support for Internet Printing Protocol (IPP), Microsoft’s preferred method for printing in Windows 11\.  For more information about this driver, please see [Appendix 6](#appendix-6:-“print-to-aidin”-installed-driver).

### **Analytics Data Export SFTP**

Aidin captures a large amount of data about how efficiently your care management team functions, how responsive your post-acute partners are, and the quality of their service. While we offer a reporting suite in the application, most customers prefer to capture this data incrementally in analytics-ready form for their own internal dashboards. Aidin uses SFTP to deliver this data to you.

By default, Aidin will send scheduled data extracts to the same SFTP endpoint that we have set up for inbound (push) documents, accessible by a separate user account. A unique SSH key will need to be generated \- see [Appendix 1](#appendix-1:-procedure-for-creating-ssh-key-pairs) for more.

If you prefer, Aidin can push raw analytics data to an SFTP server that you host instead.  You might decide to do this if you want to retain control over data retention.  If you prefer this option, you will need to share the location of your SFTP machine and install a user account with Aidin’s public key:

##### **Aidin’s Data Export Public Key**

```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAINbzmQxcKpSfx86zo+lSYXYEa1uiGzWyaZ1z0RdaotGS
```

##### **Export Schedule**

Our data extracts are sent incrementally every morning (by 8am Eastern) as a CSV. Each file includes all rows that were updated on the previous day. You will need an ETL process to upsert (update or insert) new files into your data store to avoid duplicated data. Your exports will be stored in /reports/\<report\_name\>/\<file\_name\>.csv on the SFTP server, and if you are self-hosting you will need to instruct us where to place the files. The default filename for exports is:

```
{customer}-{report_name}-{report_schedule}-{report_date}-{run_start_epoch}.csv
```

**Note:** run\_start\_epoch is the Unix time the report was run and indicates the order in which files should be processed.

We will provide you with additional documentation describing the schema and field definitions for your data team to understand how to process and analyze your data.

### **Essential Integrations Checklist**

At this point in the integration process you have: 

1. Allowlisted all Aidin domains and/or IPs.  
2. Provided Aidin with the list of facilities and facility codes needed to support your health system.  
3. Configured at least one SSO solution with auto-provisioned users and groups to allow your users to log in with the appropriate roles and facility access.  
4. An Aidin Launch button in your EHR that kicks off the aforementioned SSO process.  
5. Tested logging in from the Aidin login page.  
6. Tested an ADT feed over mTLS or IP-allowlisted connections, which means you’re able to see patient records in the Aidin interface.  
7. Have configured bi-directional SFTP for pushing documents to Aidin from your EHR as receiving analytics data delivery.    
8. You’ve set up printing (if preferred). Ideally, you’ve also identified other supported ways of retrieving your documents into Aidin.

Congratulations\! If you’ve completed the above steps you’re ready to move on to additional Advanced integrations and populating the content of your Aidin installation.

## Advanced Integrations

Once Essential integrations are completed, referral workflows can be improved and data sharing made more seamless by configuring Aidin to talk to your EHR via FHIR, and as necessary, direct HL7 MDM messages. We can use this access to pull patient documents from your EHR, send progress notes, after-visit-summary (AVS) data, and push documents (such as patient choice lists) back to your systems.  Subscribers of certain Aidin modules can also have their inbound fax numbers ported to Aidin’s inbound fax service to allow documents to enter Aidin directly from payor and post-acute partners. Finally, simple Aidin’s workflows can be made available directly within Epic using our Epic CRN integration.

### **“Pull” Document Retrieval**

Aidin supports a standards-based FHIR integration for securely retrieving patient documents directly from your EHR via the Patient, Encounter, DocumentReference and Binary endpoints. Individual patient attachments and packaged reports must be available as DocumentReference resources explicitly tied to the patient’s encounter. This is useful for retrieving static documents that are already associated with the patient’s chart, as opposed to the dynamic documents that are often created on demand and must be “pushed” to Aidin via SFTP or Printing.

[Appendix 4](#appendix-7:-fhir-integration-setup-\(also-known-as-epic-app-orchard-handshake\)) describes the information Aidin needs from your team to interface with your EHR via FHIR. Once this information has been provided and the appropriate OAuth2 scopes granted, Aidin can use the to retrieve the list of documents associated with a patient Encounter, then the documents themselves. 

### **AVS and Progress Notes**

Aidin supports sending two types of structured, non-PDF data back to Epic over the FHIR DocumentReference.Create endpoint.  Both require you to complete the “Epic App Orchard Handshake” process to allow Aidin to authenticate via OAuth2. Please see [Appendix 7](#appendix-7:-fhir-integration-setup-\(also-known-as-epic-app-orchard-handshake\)) for both AVS and Progress Note integrations.

#### **After Visit Summaries (AVS)** 

After Visit Summary (AVS) Integration allows care managers to send key referral details from Aidin back to the EMR. When a provider is reserved, Aidin sends comprehensive discharge destination information such as: 

* Provider details: Provider type, name, full address, phone and fax  
* Care timing: Start of care date (discharge date) or pickup time for transportation

**Sample AVS note**

Aidin can be configured to send referral updates or care instructions directly into the After Visit Summary (AVS) provided to the patient.  There is a great deal of variation in where and how our customers want this to appear in the AVS; Aidin cannot provide guidance beyond the schema of the FHIR message that we deliver (see [Appendix 8](#appendix-8:-sample-fhir-documentreference.create-payloads)) using DocumentReference.Create. This is an integration that requires you to engage your Epic Technical Services team. 

AVS updates to your EHR can be either manual or automated from Aidin.  Example trigger events can be based on specific referral events, such as:

* New reservations on a referral  
* Changes to the placement on a reserved referral:  
  * Cancel the reserved referral.  
  * Make changes to the reserved provider.  
  * Restarting the referral using “Skip to Task”.  
  * Reopen the deadline to invite new providers.  
  * Receiving user marks that the patient is no longer coming.

Please let your Aidin Implementation Manager know whether you would prefer manual or automated events, as well as which events should trigger an update.

#### **Progress Notes**
Aidin can generate and send referral details that appear as a text summary in the Progress Notes tab in Epic.  This integration also makes use of the DocumentReference.Create endpoint, but with significantly less work on the part of your Interface team. Documents created with the Progress Note coding should automatically appear in your Epic system. Please see [Appendix 8](#appendix-8:-sample-fhir-documentreference.create-payloads) for more details about the schema and coding of these messages. 

Progress Notes use case enables health systems to automatically send detailed referral documentation to Epic systems when specific clinical events occur such as: 

* Patient: Full name  
* MRN: Patient medical record number  
* Aidin Request ID: Aidin referral number  
* Level of care reserved: Provider type  
* Partner Reserved: Provider name, city, state, zip and phone  
* Clinical needs requested: Care types  
* Geography searched: Search radius and zip code or county name  
* Start of Service: Start of care date

###   **Medical Document Management (MDM)** 

Aidin can be configured to send structured documents (e.g., PDFs) to Epic, where they are stored in the patient’s chart—typically in the Media or External Documents section. This is done using HL7 v2.x MDM^T02  (new document) or MDM^T08 (updated document) message types.  Some customers prefer that Aidin sends all messages as “new” documents; please make it clear to your Implementation Manager how you want Aidin configured. 

If you would like to enable this configuration, Aidin will need the endpoint and port where your Epic system will receive inbound HL7 messages. This is generally provided by your EHR Interface team.  For more details about how to configure the MDM document integration please see [Appendix 9](#appendix-9:-hl7-mdm-configuration). 

### **Onbase Document Storage**

Aidin can also be configured to send structured documents (e.g., PDFs) to your EHR via Onbase, a common enterprise content management system. The standard workflow for this integration follows several key steps: initiate upload, upload document, assign keywords, and confirm archival into Onbase. If you have specific HIMS compliance requirements—such as stamps, metadata or keyword mappings—for documents transmitted to Onbase, Aidin can work with your HIMS IT team to satisfy these requirements. 

If you would like to enable this configuration, Aidin will need the Onbase endpoints, any proxy/gateway authentication details, and documentation compliance requirements.

### **Inbound Fax** 

Aidin can be configured to receive inbound documents through a dedicated fax number to support both payor and post-acute authorization workflows. If your team prefers to reuse an existing fax number you will need to complete a fax number port. Aidin is also able to assign you a new fax number. Please communicate your preference to your Aidin Implementation Manager.

### **Epic CRN** 

Health systems that are using Epic’s Community Resource Network (CRN) module to send referrals can take advantage of Aidin’s provider directory and proprietary matching system, as well as other Aidin referral management innovations, directly within their EHR using Aidin’s Epic CRN integration. This allows Care Managers to automate referral submissions, receive provider response notification, and close the loop on care completion for many referral types without having to log into Aidin.

The CRN module supports simple referral management workflows such as requesting home care from a clinic visit or a non-emergency transport ride back home. Managing complex workflows or edge cases still requires care managers to log into the Aidin’s platform.

Tight collaboration between Aidin, Epic build team for your organization, and care management leadership will be required to implement this solution for your team. You can start the process by connecting with your Epic representative to request the CRN module and naming Aidin as your referral management vendor.

## Application Content

Before launch, Aidin needs to configure menus, document templates, and other workflows with your data to optimize your experience.  Aidin will share a spreadsheet to facilitate this exchange of information.  The first tab of the worksheet provides a template through which you provide the facilities of your system. Tab 1 is a pre-requisite to Essential integrations.  **Aidin recommends that you save this spreadsheet to Sharepoint (or your equivalent productivity suite) and then invite the Aidin team to access it. This allows multiple users to provide the information we need without having to email attachments back and forth.**

### **Post-Acute Care Network & Outreach** 

Aidin conducts outreach to your existing network of post-acute providers via automated email and fax campaigns. Aidin cross-references and de-duplicates this information against its existing database of providers before outreach begins, but incomplete information can lead to a poor experience for your PAC partners. Please provide this information on tab 3 of the accompanying worksheet.

### **Insurance Information** 

Aidin needs a one-time extract of all insurance providers your health system has interacted with in the past year. This data helps Aidin ensure accurate tracking of insurance information and supports processing authorization requests and finding the right in-network providers. The data provides valuable insights into the your payer mix and is crucial for aligning referral processes with provider and payor requirements. Please provide this information on tab 4 of the accompanying worksheet.

### **Bulk User Upload** 

Aidin prefers not to bulk add users, but in some implementations – specifically those without “auto-provisioned” users, this becomes a requirement. Not only does this create an extra step for both sides during an implementation, it does not align with best practice – your identity management solution (IdP) should be the source of truth for who can access Aidin on your behalf, not a spreadsheet. 

If bulk user add is a requirement because your team cannot configure SSO or groups/SAML claims, please complete the “Users” tab in the accompanying worksheet. Keep in mind that after go-live, your Aidin admins will need to manage user access directly in the platform.  Aidin cannot manage user access on your behalf post-launch.
