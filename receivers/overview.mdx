Aidin provides hospitals and care managers tools to help discharge patients to post acute care providers, generally called "receivers" in the Aidin ecosystem. 
If you use Aidin to receive and respond to referrals (or authorizations for care), this guide is for you.

Some post-acute providers work with services that consolidate referrals from multiple sources into purpose built systems. If that describes your business,
this is also the right place to learn more about how Aidin can help the post-acute providers you support.

Please note that headless browser automation and other forms of bot activity are a violation of Aidin's Terms of Service. Aidin offers an [Event Subscription](/receivers/integration) solution for those use cases.

Aidin does not charge referral receivers to use the platform, but advanced feature sets are available for those who want more insight into hospital decision making, need advanced login support, or other administrative goodies. 
If you would like to learn more, please contact our team. 

This guide is devoted to helping you understand what Aidin has to offer you, including the ability to send referrals to your referral receiving partners as well.
